This is a basic template latex file for NSF proposals.  It contains a
skeleton proposal file with relevant instructions from the [[http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg][2015 NSF
grant proposal guide]].  I did my best to make sure this is accurate,
but it is of course your responsibility to ensure your proposal meets
the requirements.

The idea for this, along with the original draft of the code, came
from Sarah Gille's webpage [[http://www-pord.ucsd.edu/~sgille/how_to/proposal_prep.html][here]].  The formatting is pretty basic and
doesn't /really/ call for a latex style file.  The main thing this
does is to update the page numbering for each section to make it easy
for reviewers to know you're within the limits.  Starting out with a
skeleton file like this and filling it in as you go is also an easy
way to be sure you have all the required sections.  I also include a
custom bibtex style file which meets the NSF requirements.

I provide a Makefile, since I find that useful.  I recommend compiling
with [[https://launchpad.net/rubber][rubber]], which is available via homebrew if you use an Apple
computer.  I also provide a ruby script to split the file into
different sections for uploading into fastlane.  This is a little
hacky and may not always work, but when it does, it saves you some
time.

this is a basic template tex file for nsf proposals.  it contains a
skeleton proposal file with relevant instructions from the [[http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=gpg][2015 NSF
grant proposal guide]].  i did my best to make sure this is accurate,
but it is of course your responsibility to ensure your proposal meets
the requirements.

i also provide a ruby script to split the file into different sections
for uploading into fastlane.  this is a little hacky and may not
always work, but when it does, it saves you some time.

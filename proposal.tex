%% E - REFERENCES CITED

% Reference information is required. Each reference must include the
% names of all authors (in the same sequence in which they appear in
% the publication), the article and journal title, book title, volume
% number, page numbers, and year of publication. If the document is
% available electronically, the website address also should be
% identified. Proposers must be especially careful to follow accepted
% scholarly practices in providing citations for source materials
% relied upon when preparing any section of the proposal. While there
% is no established page limitation for the references, this section
% must include bibliographic citations only and must not be used to
% provide parenthetical information outside of the 15-page Project
% Description.
